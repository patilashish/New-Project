Initially a chessboard with sensors is used for the playing. These physical movements are displayed on the screen at same time. Tracking of keys will help in the detection of the keys. Mainly this project has combined two major Concepts that is Artificial Intelligence & Virtual Reality.\r\nLanguages\r\nHTML/CSS\r\nPHP\r\nJava JDK\r\nJavaScript ,J2EE C, C++, XML\r\nSQL, PL/SQL\r\nSkills\r\nPHOTOSHOP\r\nFLASH\r\nFlorida International University, Miami, FL\r\n​2014-2015\r\n \r\nI'm a paragraph.

I know how critical and important it is.). Then I also got involved in development team where I worked on java in Eclipse. java, JDBC Java Database Connectivity and ODBC   Open Database Connectivity .I also have developed number of survey in html and css in website.\r\n\r\nOnline Patient Management Sysytem (Software Engineering)\r\nProject development followed SDLC agile methodology,In which I have used Java 8 Programming Language for developing application logic in Eclipse and MySQL for database, COCOMO Constructive Cost Model II model for cost estimation I learnt and used Bootstrap for front end, and also worked on Papyrus plugin in Eclipse for creation of all UML (Unified modelling language) diagrams like use case, object, class, sequence, deployment etc.I generated test cases and tested in Junit and Selenium.\r\n\r\nImplementation of Artificial Intelligence for Best Moves using Chessboard\r\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims to create it. This is an application of Artificial Intelligence. Initially a chessboard with sensors are used for the playing. This is then displayed in the screen. This chess playing consists of two major parts. First, is the detecting of the illegal moves. This avoids the player from making wrong moves. Second part gives you the best moves that can be achieved while playing. The best moves can be provided for any person who is new for the chess playing. The minimax algorithm and the alpha- beta pruning is used for the best moves implementation. The Artificial Intelligence is used in the best moves implementation. This chess playing provides the above two important features.\r\nProject paper published in International Journal of Computer Science and Information technology.(Click on Image of project to see published paper)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
